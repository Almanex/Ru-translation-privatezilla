## About

Spydish integrates the most critical Windows 10 privacy policies and allows you to quickly perform a privacy check against these policies. Active policies are marked with the status "Configured" as in the Group Policy Editor and indicates that your privacy is protected. The inactive ones are declared as "Not configured". All available policies (currently 60) can be enabled as well as disabled.

The community package for Spydish adds support for several advanced scripting features based upon PowerShell, e.g.
- Removal of specific pre-installed apps
- Uninstall of OneDrive 
- Unping Startmenu tiles 
- Disable telemetry of third-party apps (E.g. CCleaner, Firefox, Dropbox, Microsoft Office)
- Removal of Windows Defender (NOT recommended! I can highly recommend using Windows Defender on consumer versions of Windows 10)
- Blocking telemetry via firewall and host files. Rules are provided by [crazy-max/WindowsSpyBlocker](https://github.com/crazy-max/WindowsSpyBlocker)
